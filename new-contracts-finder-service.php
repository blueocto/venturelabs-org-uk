		<h1>New Contracts Finder service</h1>
		<h2>Find public sector procurement tender and contract documents</h2>
		<p><strong>The Prime Minister launched Contracts Finder on 11 February 2011. At the launch event at the Treasury in London, the PM said the Government was determined to make government procurement &ldquo;more welcoming&rdquo; for small and medium-sized enterprises. The Government's goal, he said, is to ensure that at least a 25 percent share of government contracts end up awarded to SMEs. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-launches-contracts-finder" target="_blank">find details of the announcement on the Number10 website<span> - Opens in a new window</span></a>.</strong></p>
		<p><a href="https://data.gov.uk/data/contracts-finder-archive/" target="_blank">Contracts Finder<span> - Opens in a new window</span></a> is a free new service for businesses, central government buyers and the public. It is now the main source of government procurement opportunities with a value greater than &pound;10,000. You can also use Contracts Finder to access and search for closed tender and contract documentation published by central government departments and agencies.</p>
		<p>This service is one of several practical measures that government has taken to become more open and transparent, so that it can be held to account and deliver better value for money.</p>
