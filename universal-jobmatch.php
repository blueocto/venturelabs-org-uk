		<h1>Universal Jobmatch</h1>
		<h2>DWP launch new job posting and matching service</h2>
		<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will launch Universal Jobmatch in Autumn 2012, their new job posting and matching service.</p>
		<p>This new streamlined service will allow employers to post and manage their vacancies on-line, to make it quicker and easier for them to find suitable jobseekers.</p>
		<p>Universal Jobmatch is an important part of DWP's digitalisation agenda to make more of its services available on-line. The new service will replace Employer Direct and Employer Direct Online.</p>
