		<h1>New guidance on recruiting disabled people</h1>
		<h2>Disability Clearkit developed over three years with 220 employers</h2>
		<p>A campaign promoting wider employer support for recruiting and retaining disabled workers is being supported by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).</p>
		<p>The Disability <strong>Clearkit</strong> combines the latest thinking and employer case studies with helpful tips and 'must do' check lists, which help dispel the myths that prevent many employers from recruiting disabled people.</p>
		<p>The Clearkit package is the result of three years of in-depth research with the DWP and 220 employers.</p>
