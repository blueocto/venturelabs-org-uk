		<p>To be able to operate successfully, your business might need to acquire assets or capital equipment, such as plant or machinery.</p>
		<p>These assets may include office furniture, computer equipment, company vehicles, engineering machines or service equipment.</p>
		<p>You could buy all of this equipment outright, or you might decide to rent or lease it instead. There are advantages and disadvantages in both options. This guide explains how the choice between buying and leasing can affect your business.</p>
