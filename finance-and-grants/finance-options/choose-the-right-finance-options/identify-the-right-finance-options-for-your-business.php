		<h1>Identify the right finance options for your business</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img src="/_img/access_finance_new.gif" width="94" height="62" alt="" />
		<p>Choosing and securing the right type of finance for your business is essential.</p>
		<p>There are many different types of finance available - each of them designed to meet different needs. This tool can help you by providing a personalised list of the most suitable finance options for your business.</p>
		<p>This tool is designed to point you in the direction of suitable funding pathways. Businesses are most likely to gain funding through a combination of finance options, rather than a single source.</p>
		<p>Also, it is important to be aware that to attract most forms of funding, your business should have a comprehensive business plan. Cashflow is an area that will be closely scrutinised, as is your payment record with other creditors so it is important the business is prepared before seeking finance.</p>
