		<p>If you decide to buy property for your business, you will probably need a commercial mortgage to finance the purchase. Before you take one out, it is essential that you consider the maximum monthly mortgage repayment your business can afford. You should also take into account the potential growth of your business, as relocating too often can be costly.</p>
		<p>This guide explains what information a commercial mortgage lender will need from you, what professional advice is available and the various costs. It also looks at the pros and cons of buying compared with renting, explains how to choose a lender and where to get further help.</p>
