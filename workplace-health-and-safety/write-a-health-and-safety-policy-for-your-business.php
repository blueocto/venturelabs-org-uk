		<h1>Write a health and safety policy for your business</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img src="../../_img/HS2220.gif" width="94" height="62" border="0" alt="" />
		<p>Describing how you will manage health and safety in your business will let your staff and others know about your commitment to health and safety. This will be your health and safety policy. It should clearly say who does what, when and how.</p>
		<p>If you have five or more employees, you must have a written policy.</p>
		<p>The policy does not need to be complicated or time-consuming. To help you, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) have created a template that you can download and complete. The template also includes a section for your risk assessment so that you can record everything in one document.</p>
		<p>HSE also provide an example health and safety policy to give you an idea of what to include when writing your own.</p>
		<p>A policy will only be effective if you and your staff follow it and review it regularly.</p>
