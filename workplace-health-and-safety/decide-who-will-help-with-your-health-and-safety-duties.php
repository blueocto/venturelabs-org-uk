		<h1>Decide who will help with your health and safety duties</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img src="../../_img/HS1250.gif" width="78" height="118" border="0" alt="" />
		<p>As an employer, you must appoint someone competent to help you meet your health and safety duties. A competent person is someone with the necessary skills, knowledge and experience to manage health and safety.</p>
		<p>You could appoint (one or a combination of):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>yourself</li>
			<li>one or more of your workers</li>
			<li>someone from outside your business</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You probably manage most aspects of your business yourself, or with the help of your staff. But if you are not confident of your ability to manage all health and safety in-house, you may need some external help or advice.</p>
