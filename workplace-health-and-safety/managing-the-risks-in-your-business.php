		<p>As an employer, you have a legal requirement to complete a risk assessment to identify potential hazards, and to make any changes possible to reduce the risk of accidents.</p>
		<p>You should regularly review your risk assessment to make sure it still meets all requirements and complies with health and safety legislation.</p>
		<p>This guide gives you an overview of the risk assessment process. It describes how to identify hazards and evaluate risks in the workplace, and how to decide on practical steps you can take to minimise the potential for accidents in your workplace.</p>
