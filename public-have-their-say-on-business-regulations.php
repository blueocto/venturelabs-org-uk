		<h1>Public have their say on business regulations</h1>
		<h2>Red Tape challenge now focusing on Company &amp; Commercial Law</h2>
		<p>The <strong>Red Tape Challenge</strong> (RTC) website gives the public a chance to have their say on regulations that affect their everyday lives; whether it's to speak up for well designed rules that are there to protect or to challenge badly designed regulations that are an unnecessary burden.</p>
		<p>The current challenge is <strong>Company &amp; Commercial Law.</strong></p>
		<p>Every few weeks a new set of regulations, organised around themes, will open on the website for anyone to comment on. Once a theme has closed to the public, Ministers will have three months to explain why a regulation is still required, or it will be scrapped.</p>
