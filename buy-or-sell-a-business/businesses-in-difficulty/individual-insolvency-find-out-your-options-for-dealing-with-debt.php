		<p>Bankruptcy is a very serious matter. If you become bankrupt you will have to give up any possessions of value you have. If you own a property it may have to be sold. Your personal details will be advertised in a local newspaper and the Official Receiver will investigate your conduct and financial affairs.</p>
		<p>You may have to close any business you run and dismiss your employees. Bankruptcy also places certain restrictions on your life.</p>
		<p>But you do not have to become bankrupt just because you are in debt.</p>
		<p>This tool will help you understand what alternatives may be available to you.</p>
