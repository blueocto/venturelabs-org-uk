		<h1>Complete the sale of your business</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img src="../../_img/SC1000.gif" width="78" height="118" alt="" />
		<p>There's a range of key steps to follow in order to successfully complete the sale of your business. From getting a valuation, attracting buyers and choosing advisers to identifying and approaching potential purchasers.</p>
		<p>You and your advisers will also need to conduct effective negotiations to conclude the deal to your advantage.</p>
		<p>This guide explains how to complete the sale of a business. It sets out how to approach negotiations with potential buyers and what to consider when weighing up offers. While price is important, there's a wide range of other factors you'll need to consider - from how staff will be treated to the tax implications.</p>
		<p>The guide also covers closing a sale agreement with your buyer and the checks they'll make to ensure the information they've been given about your business is correct.</p>
