		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>The sales process - from the initial approach to long after the sale is completed - is governed by a number of important legal requirements designed to protect your customers.</p>
		<p>Playing it by the book can help your business build and maintain an honest and trustworthy reputation.</p>
		<p>This guide will help you identify which laws apply to your business including online selling rules, distance selling regulations and data protection rules. It will help you understand how to comply with these rules.</p>
		<p>It provides a brief introduction to general trading rules and the special rules for retailers or specialised sectors.</p>
		<p>It looks at late-payment legislation that could affect you if you are considering taking action against late payers or if you tend to pay invoices after their due date.</p>
		<p>The guide also covers the Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS), which helps you comply with the law on age-restricted sales.</p>
