		<h1>Reach your customers effectively</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img src="/_img/advice.gif" width="94" height="62" alt="" />
		<p>Choosing the right channels to sell to your customers is a crucial decision. You need to know <b>how and where</b> customers want to buy your products or services, and the best way of getting customers to hear about them.</p>
		<p>For some businesses, reaching customers is relatively <b>straightforward</b>. High-street shops, for instance, rely on customers walking through the door.</p>
		<p>The more sales channels you use, the more customers you can reach. But each channel adds costs. If you add a new channel only to find it attracts sales away from an existing channel without bringing significant extra sales, you'll be increasing your costs for little or no benefit.</p>
		<p>This guide looks at the <b>main sales channels</b> you can choose from. It explains their strengths and weaknesses, and how you can use them to your advantage.</p>
