		<h3>Business environment</h3>
		<p>Understanding the environment your business operates in is a key part of market planning, and allows you to identify the threats and opportunities associated with your area of business. A 'PEST' analysis helps you identify the main opportunities and threats in your market:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>political</strong> and legal changes - such as new regulations</li>
			<li><strong>economic</strong> factors - such as interest rates, exchange rates and consumer confidence</li>
			<li><strong>social</strong> factors - such as changing attitudes and lifestyles, and the ageing population</li>
			<li><strong>technological</strong> factors - such as new materials and growing use of the internet</li>
