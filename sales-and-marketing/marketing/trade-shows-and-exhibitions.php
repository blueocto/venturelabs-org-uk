		<p>Trade shows and exhibitions are specialist market places that allow exhibitors to promote their products and services, reach new customers and generate new sales. They also give visitors the opportunity to find out about the products and services on display.</p>
		<p>Trade shows and exhibitions can also provide business people with the opportunity to network and make useful contacts with other people working in their industry.</p>
		<p>This guide aims to help you get the best from exhibiting at one of these events (for simplicity, we'll call them all <b>trade fairs</b>) or attending as a visitor.</p>
