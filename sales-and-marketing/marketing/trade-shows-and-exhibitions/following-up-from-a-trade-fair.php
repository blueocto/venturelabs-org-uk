		<h2>Following up from a trade fair</h2>
		<p>Don't go back to work after a trade fair and forget all about the useful information and leads you have gathered. Following up after the event is probably the most important part of the whole process - if you put it off for too long, you risk losing all the benefits you worked so hard to achieve.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Have a debriefing with the staff involved to assess what worked and what didn't.</li>
			<li>Discuss how you can make improvements for future events while your impressions are still fresh.</li>
			<li>Measure your success against the goals you established before the fair.</li>
			<li>Follow up all the leads you made. Depending on their interest, follow-up could be anything from a sales visit to a phone call, email, letter or information pack.</li>
			<li>Evaluate the success of these leads. You will probably want to wait a few months to do this - moving from contact to customer can take a while.</li>
			<li>Follow up leads with other people who visited your stand, including media representatives who might be looking for post-fair stories to run.</li>
			<li>If you intend to exhibit again, reserve your place so you get the best site next year.</li>
