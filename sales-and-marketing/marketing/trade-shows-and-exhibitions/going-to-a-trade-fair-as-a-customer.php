		<h2>Going to a trade fair as a customer</h2>
		<p>If you have chosen the right trade fair, it's an ideal place to find relevant <b>suppliers</b> gathered under one roof and to do some useful <b>networking</b>. You should be able to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>see new and relevant products or services</li>
			<li>compare new products and services, try them out and ask questions</li>
			<li>find new and specialist suppliers</li>
			<li>encounter new ideas and innovative companies</li>
			<li>get up to date with new technologies</li>
			<li>make contact with other people in your area of business, and tap into their expertise and enthusiasm</li>
		</ul>

		<p>To make sure you get the best value from the time and resources you have put into attending the fair, plan your visit and your objectives - make them specific and measurable, such as finding three new suppliers or making five new contacts in a particular area. Evaluate whether you have achieved these objectives.</p>
