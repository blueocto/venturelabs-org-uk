		<h1>Taking on a new member of staff?</h1>
		
		<h2>Use our new and improved interactive tools</h2>
		<p>We have launched three new tools to help you through the process of taking on a new member of staff.</p>
		<p>You can find the new tools on <a href="/employment-and-skills/take-on-staff/help-with-recruitment.php.html">a single page within the Employment and skills section of the site</a>. They deal separately with:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/employing-staff" title="Employing staff for the first time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recruiting staff</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-checks-job-applicants" title="Checks employers can make on job applicants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">making pre-employment checks and contracts of employment</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/employing-staff" title="Employing staff for the first time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting new workers started</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Previously, a single tool attempted to cover all three stages of this process. We listened to your feedback about this tool, which told us that it contained too many questions and took too long to work through.</p>
		<p>You also told us that the process of taking on a new member of staff could be broken down into smaller, separate stages. You wanted to know your obligations at each stage separately, without having to sift through information about the other stages at the same time.</p>
		<p>The three shorter tools that we have developed will provide just the information that you need, when you need it.</p>
		<p>A related tool for when you're <a href="/tax-payroll-and-company-information/paye-for-employers/introduction-to-paye-for-employers/paying-an-employee-for-the-first-time.php.html">paying an employee for the first time</a> can also be found at the single page within the Employment and skills section of the site.</p>
