		<h2>Initiative to let unused government estate to business start ups</h2>
		<p>Government is opening up its unused and underused office space to start-ups. To make this happen we need to recruit providers to manage the space and to provide a package of support to these new businesses.</p>
		<p>31 May, Government announced details of space available in twenty buildings across England with the potential to be used by aspiring entrepreneurs to build and grow their businesses. We are pleased to announce today (2 July) that a further four spaces are now available.</p>
		<p>To allow existing bidders the opportunity to bid for these spaces we are extending the closing date of this procurement to 23rd July.</p>
		<p>We are inviting bids from organisations, with a background in managing business start-up space and a background in supporting new businesses, to manage these locations on behalf of Government.</p>
