		<h2>Get &pound;1,500 for recruiting an apprentice aged 16 to 24</h2>
		<p>If you're interested in recruiting your first apprentice, now's the ideal time.</p>
		<p>The National Apprenticeship Service (NAS) is offering grants of &pound;1,500 to employers who take on a young person aged between 16 and 24. NAS will pay up to 100 per cent of their training costs as well.</p>
		<p>The Apprenticeship Grant for Employers &ndash; known as <strong>AGE 16 to 24</strong> - will help you meet the initial costs of taking on your apprentice. It runs until March 2013 and is open to businesses in England that employ fewer than 250 people. The grant is offered on a 'first come first served' basis.</p>
		<p>You may also be able to access the grant if you haven't recruited an apprentice since April 2009 and you feel that your business could benefit from taking on another apprentice. Up to three grants per organisation will be paid.</p>
		<p>If your apprentice is aged between 16 and 18, NAS will pay their training costs in full. For apprentices aged between 19 and 24, NAS will pay 50 per cent of the training costs.</p>
		<p>More support and assistance is available through the network of Apprenticeship training providers. They can help you advertise your job vacancy free of charge on the Apprenticeship vacancies website, and support you throughout the recruitment process. Your training provider will check that your business meets the grant criteria, and help you apply. They'll also claim the grant on your behalf from the NAS, and make the payment to you directly.</p>
