		<h1>Register online for business taxes</h1>
		<p>HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in partnership with Venture Labs provide an online tax registration service. The service is aimed at small businesses who need to tell HMRC they are a new business, new employer, or new to VAT.</p>
		<p>You can register for the key taxes that are relevant to your business and be enrolled for the HMRC Online Services at the same time:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Corporation Tax</li>
			<li>Self Assessment</li>
			<li>PAYE for employers</li>
			<li>VAT</li>
		</ul>
		<a href="#">Register for business taxes using the online tax registration service</a>
		<p><strong>Important Note</strong> &ndash; If you have already told HMRC that you have started in business and have received your reference number, you do not need to do so again. If you have a Self Assessment or Corporation Tax Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR), a VAT registration number or Employer reference you can sign up to use HMRC Online Services to deal with HMRC and file your tax return online.</p>
