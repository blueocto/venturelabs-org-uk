		<h2>How will the Budget affect your business?</h2>

		<p>You can find full details of the Budget announcements on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HM Treasury website</a>, <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2012/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMRC website</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/budget-2012--2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIS website</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>Key announcements for business</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The main rate of <strong>corporation tax</strong> will be reduced by an additional one per cent, so that the rate will reduce from 26 per cent to 24 per cent in April 2012, to 23 per cent in April 2013 and will come down to 22 per cent by April 2014.</li>
			<li>Corporation tax reliefs will be introduced from April 2013 for the <strong>video games, animation and high-end television industries</strong>, subject to state aid approval and following consultation.</li>

			<li>A cap will be introduced on all unlimited <strong>income tax reliefs</strong>, of &pound;50,000 or 25% of income, whichever is higher.</li>
