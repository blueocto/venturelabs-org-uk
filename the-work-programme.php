		<h1>The Work Programme</h1>
		<h2>Supporting long-term unemployed and sick people back into work</h2>
		<p>The Work Programme is the biggest single payment by results employment programme ever introduced. It is delivered by private and voluntary organisations called providers. They are paid to help long-term unemployed people, claiming Jobseeker's Allowance or sickness benefits, into work.</p>
		<p>The Work Programme providers are free to innovate and design support that is tailored to an individual's needs. They will work closely with employers in their area to understand and support the local labour market. Your local provider could help you with your recruitment needs and find the right person for the job.</p>
