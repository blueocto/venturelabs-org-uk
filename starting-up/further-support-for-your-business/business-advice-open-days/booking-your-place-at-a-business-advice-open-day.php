			<h1>Business Advice Open Days</h1>
			<h2>Booking your place at a Business Advice Open Day</h2>
			<p>If you want to attend a Business Advice Open Day, please register your interest with HMRC in advance. It is possible to drop in on the day, but you may not be able to attend a seminar if all the places have been reserved.</p>
			<p>You can notify HMRC in two ways. You can <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120418183332/http://www.events.businesslink.gov.uk/eventsearch?text=BAOD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book an event on the Events Finder website and you will be sent an automatic email reminder</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>How to book</h3>
			<p>You can book your place in one of three ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>book online and you will receive an automatic reminder ahead of the event to confirm your attendance</li>
				<li>if you have received a flyer through the post because you live in the local area, you can fax your booking to Fax 01642 755214</li>
				<li>if you prefer, you can call the HMRC Business Advice Open Day Booking Line on Tel 0845 603 2691.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>You should also use this number if you would like to tell the organisers about any special access, communication or personal needs you may have before the day.</p>

			<h3>Amending a booking</h3>
			<p>To amend a booking for a Business Advice Open Day, you will need your booking reference and your email address you used to book.</p>

			<h3>Automatic booking confirmation</h3>
			<p>If you book online, you should receive an automatic confirmation. This confirmation should have all the details of your booking plus a unique reference number.</p>
			<p>If you have booked by fax or post, you should expect to receive a fax confirmation two to three weeks before the event.</p>
			
			<h3>Do I have to pay to attend an event?</h3>
			<p>The events are free to attend as the costs are met jointly by HMRC's main partners. There is no charge to attend any of the programmes or seminars. However, you will usually be required to pay for refreshments and not all venues can offer free parking.</p>
			<p>It is not necessary to book to attend a roadshow but booking is required for seminars, as spaces are limited. </p>
