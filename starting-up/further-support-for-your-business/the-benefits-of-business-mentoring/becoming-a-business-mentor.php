			<h1>The benefits of business mentoring</h1>
			<h2>Becoming a business mentor</h2>
			<p>If you already have plenty of business experience, you could consider offering your services as a mentor to other businesses. This can be a very rewarding way of passing on the benefits of your experience.</p>
			<p>As a mentor, your role is to support, develop, stimulate and challenge your mentee, whether they're just starting up in business or are already established and seeking guidance.</p>
			<p>You can mentor in a variety of ways - including online, face to face, by telephone, or as part of a discussion group. You can charge a fee for your services or offer free support.</p>
			
			<h3>The Get Mentoring initiative</h3>
			<p>Get Mentoring aims to increase the number of volunteer business mentors in the UK by recruiting and training 15,000 volunteer mentors from the small, medium and micro business community. The initiative is led by the Small Firms Enterprise Development Initiative.</p>
			<p>A free training course - Introduction to Enterprise Mentoring - will equip you with the skills and knowledge you need to become an effective mentor.</p>
