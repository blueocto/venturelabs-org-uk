		<h1>Stock control and inventory</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img src="/_img/SU0580new.gif" width="78" height="118" border="0" alt="" />
		<p>Stock control, otherwise known as <strong>inventory control</strong>, is used to show how much stock you have at any one time, and how you keep track of it.</p>
		<p>It applies to every item you use to produce a product or service, from raw materials to finished goods. It covers stock at every stage of the production process, from purchase and delivery to using and re-ordering the stock.</p>
		<p>Efficient stock control allows you to have the right amount of stock in the right place at the right time. It ensures that capital is not tied up unnecessarily, and protects production if problems arise with the supply chain.</p>
		<p>This guide explains different stock control methods, shows you how to set one up and tells you where to find more information.</p>
