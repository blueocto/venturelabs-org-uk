			<h1>Environmental responsibilities</h1>
			<h2>Does my business need a permit or licence?</h2>
			<p>You may require a permit or licence if your business poses certain types of environmental risk. For example if your business:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>collects or transports waste</strong> on behalf of others, or transports your own construction or demolition waste, you must register as a waste carrier with your environmental regulator - this is the Environment Agency in England and Wales, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) or the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA)</li>
				<li>carries out <strong>waste activities</strong> such as treating, storing or disposing of other people's waste, you may need an environmental permit or an exemption from your environmental regulator</li>
				<li>carries out <strong>industrial, waste or intensive agricultural activities</strong>, or uses hazardous substances such as solvents, you may need an environmental permit or a pollution prevention and control permit from your local authority or environmental regulator</li>
				<li><strong>allows anything other than</strong> clean, uncontaminated <strong>water</strong> from your premises into watercourses or surface water drains, you must have a discharge consent from your environmental regulator</li>
				<li>discharges <strong>trade effluent</strong> into the sewerage system, you must get consent from your water company or water authority</li>
				<li>takes water from surface water or groundwater, ie not from the mains supply, you may need an abstraction licence from your environmental regulator</li>
			</ul>
