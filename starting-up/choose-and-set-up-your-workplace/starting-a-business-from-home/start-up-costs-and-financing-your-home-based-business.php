		<h2>Start-up costs and financing your home-based business</h2>
		<p>If you are looking for some extra funds, there are various options to consider.</p>

		<h3>Initial costs</h3>
		<p>You will need to buy, lease or rent the equipment for your home office and any materials you need for the service you are supplying. Find out more in our guide <a href="/finance-and-grants/manage-your-cashflow/decide-whether-to-lease-or-buy-assets.php">decide whether to lease or buy assets</a>.</p>
		<p>Finding and keeping in touch with customers is a major issue, so investing in a good computer with relevant software and a broadband connection will be a priority in most cases.</p>
		<p>The most common costs to consider when starting out are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a computer or laptop</li>
			<li>broadband access</li>
			<li>mobile phone</li>
			<li>office desk or chair</li>
			<li>business cards</li>
			<li>stock - if you're supplying products</li>
