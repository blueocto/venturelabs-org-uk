		<h1>Starting a business from home </h1>
		<h2>Your growth options</h2>
		<p>When it comes to growing your business, one popular option is to focus on what you do best and outsource the rest.</p>
		<p>If you are thinking of employing people, you need to determine their employment status, for example whether you will treat them as employees, contractors or sub-contractors, or simply 'volunteer' family and friends.</p>
		<p>See our guide on <a href="/employment-and-skills/take-on-staff/taking-on-staff-the-options.php">taking on staff - the options</a>.</p>
		<p>If you employ someone, you will have extra responsibilities relating to health and safety.</p>
		<p>See our guide on <a href="/workplace-health-and-safety/what-you-need-to-do-about-health-and-safety.php">what you need to do about health and safety</a>.</p>
		<h3>Outsourcing</h3>
		<p>You can grow your business without increasing headcount or expanding your premises, by outsourcing, for example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>accounts</li>
			<li>administration</li>
			<li>telemarketing - for generating leads</li>
			<li>PR</li>
			<li>design and copywriting</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For more information, see our guide on <a href="/grow-your-business/growth-through-strategic-sourcing/outsourcing.php">outsourcing</a>.</p>
		<h3>Meeting spaces</h3>
		<p>As your business grows, you may find that your home is no longer suitable for all your business needs. Remember that you can rent managed workspace and meeting facilities for occasional use through business centres. These can be found in central locations in many towns across the UK.</p>
