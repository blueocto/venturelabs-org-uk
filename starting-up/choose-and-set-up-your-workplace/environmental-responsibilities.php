		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img src="/_img/responsibilities.gif" width="78" height="118" border="0" alt="" />
		<p>You have a legal responsibility for the impact your business has on the environment. For example, it's up to you to ensure that your waste is treated and disposed of properly.</p>
		<p>Going beyond environmental compliance can also bring business benefits. Many businesses have realised that acting in a socially and environmentally responsible way is more than just a legal duty. It affects your bottom line and the long-term success of your business.</p>
		<p>This guide outlines your main environmental responsibilities. It also explains where you can find more detailed information and help on environmental issues and sustainable development.</p>
