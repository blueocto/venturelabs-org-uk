		<h2>Special rules for businesses that sell to customers in their home or workplace</h2>
		<p>Since 1 October 2008, consumers have had the same rights to a cooling-off period for sales resulting from a solicited call by a trader as they do for sales resulting from an unsolicited visit by a trader to a consumer's home, workplace or at a location arranged by the trader away from their business premises. This means that consumers who agree to purchase goods or services with a total payment value of more than &pound;35 can cancel any agreement within a seven day cooling-off period. Businesses that have not yet done so should review their contracts and sales practices and make necessary adjustments.</p>

		<p>If you sell goods <strong>to consumers</strong> online - via the internet, email, digital TV or mobile-phone text messages - you must comply with the distance selling regulations. See the page in this guide on <a href="/starting-up/sales-and-marketing/comply-with-the-law-in-the-provision-of-goods-facilities-and-services/rules-for-businesses-that-dont-sell-to-customers-face-to-face.php">rules for businesses that don't sell to consumers face to face</a>.</p>
		<p>Similar requirements apply if you sell goods online <strong>to businesses</strong>. However, business customers do not have an automatic right to cancel.</p>
		<p>Whether you are selling to consumers or businesses, you must provide customers with additional information, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>your VAT number (if applicable)</li>
			<li>details of membership of any professional organisations</li>
			<li>an opportunity to correct orders before they are completed</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Information on how to place an order, and how to correct errors made while placing it, must be provided before the order is made. You must also acknowledge orders promptly.</p>
		<p>
			<p>Most other information can be made available on your website. <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090609024734/http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/sectors/ecommerce/ecommsdirectivefaqs/page10148.html" title="Frequently asked questions on the electronic commerce regulations on the BIS website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find information on the electronic commerce regulations on the BIS website</a>. </p>
