		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img src="/_img/gavel.gif" width="94" height="74" border="0" alt="" />
		<p>If you are considering setting up a business, it's worth thinking carefully about which structure best suits the way that you intend to do business, as this will affect:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>which authorities you have to notify that your business exists</li>
			<li>the tax and National Insurance that you pay</li>
			<li>the records and accounts that you have to keep</li>
			<li>your financial liability if the business runs into trouble</li>
			<li>the ways your business can raise money</li>
			<li>the way management decisions are made about the business</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There are several structures to choose from, depending on your situation. This guide will help you understand the differences between them.</p>
		<p>If you are not sure which legal structure would best suit your business, you can&nbsp;get advice from an accountant or solicitor.</p>
