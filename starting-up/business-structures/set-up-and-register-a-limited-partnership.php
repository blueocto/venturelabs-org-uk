		<h1>Set up and register a limited partnership</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>A limited partnership is a business structure which has both general and limited partners. General partners are liable for the full amount of the partnership's debt, whereas limited partners are only liable for the debts or obligations that they initially invest in the business.</p>
		<p>There may be benefits for running your business as a limited partnership - however, there are certain procedures that you are required to follow as a limited partnership.</p>
		<p>This guide explains what a limited partnership is, and how it can be created. It explains why limited partnerships must be registered with Companies House and how you can do this. It also tells you how limited partnerships are treated for tax purposes.</p>
