			<h1>Legal structures: the basics</h1>
			<h2>Setting up specific types of limited company</h2>
			<p>Instead of setting up a 'standard' type of public or private company, you could consider setting up a:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Community Interest Company</li>
				<li>Right-to-manage company</li>
				<li>Societas Europaea or European company</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These types of company are subject to company law in the same way as standard public or private companies - see the pages in this guide on <a href="/starting-up/business-structures/legal-structures-the-basics/starting-a-private-company.php">starting a private company</a> and <a href="/starting-up/business-structures/legal-structures-the-basics/setting-up-specific-types-of-limited-company.php">starting a public limited company</a>.</p>
			<p>However, they must meet additional criteria in order to qualify as the company type concerned.</p>
			<p>Note also that you can register one of these types of company via a paper application form only - ie you cannot register electronically.</p>
			
			<h3>Community Interest Company (CIC)</h3>
			<p>A CIC is a type of limited company designed for people who want to run a business for the benefit of the community - ie not purely for the benefit of the company's members and shareholders.</p>
			<p>A CIC may be a public or private company limited by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>share capital</li>
				<li>guarantee with or without share capital</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A company cannot become a CIC if it is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>is a charity</li>
				<li>intends to be a political party, a political campaigning organisation, or a subsidiary of either</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you intend to set up a CIC, you must register it with Companies House. You can register either via a paper application form or electronically using a third party with access to the necessary software - eg an incorporation agent, software provider or solicitor.</p>
			<p>However, it's the CIC Regulator that decides whether or not your company is eligible to become a CIC.</p>
			<p>To be accepted, you must pass a 'community interest test' and 'asset lock'. These ensure that the:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>CIC is established for community purposes</li>
				<li>assets and profits are dedicated to these purposes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>CICs are often seen as a type of social enterprises and may take the form of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>leisure centres</li>
				<li>housing associations</li>
				<li>worker-owned co-operatives</li>
				<li>community development trusts</li>
			</ul>
			<p>See our guide on how to <a href="/starting-up/business-structures/set-up-a-social-enterprise.php">set up a social enterprise</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Right-to-manage (RTM) company</h3>
			<p>A RTM company is run by leaseholders who have taken on the landlord's management functions, eg repairs and maintenance of the premises.</p>
			<p>For a company to be a RTM company in relation to those premises:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>it must be a private company limited by guarantee</li>
				<li>its articles of association must state that its object, or one of its objects, is gaining the right to manage those premises</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Societas Europaea (SE)</h3>
			<p>An SE is a trans-European company that may be created on registration in any European Economic Area state.</p>
			<p>If you wish to create an SE in the UK, you must register it with Companies House.</p>
			<p>An SE can be formed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>by merger</li>
				<li>as a subsidiary</li>
				<li>as a holding company</li>
				<li>by a PLC transforming itself into an SE</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If registered in the UK, an SE:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>is a public limited company (PLC) formed in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation</li>
				<li>must have both its registered office and head office in the UK - although they don't have to be at the same address</li>
			</ul>
			<p>An SE must have share capital and shareholders whose liability is limited in a similar manner to that of a PLC.</p>
			<p>An SE may denominate its share capital in any currency provided that at least &pound;50,000 is denominated in sterling or &euro;57,100 is denominated in euros.</p>
			<p>It must also have a minimum amount of subscribed share capital equivalent to &euro;120,000.</p>
			<p>As a PLC, an SE registered in the UK must submit an annual return to, and file company accounts with, Companies House.</p>
