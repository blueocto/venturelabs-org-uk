		<h1>How do I survive until my business is off the ground?</h1>
		<h2>Find support</h2>
		<p>Most businesses need assistance at some stage in their development. This is especially true of businesses in the early days.</p>
		There are a number of sources of help, including:
		<ul>
			<li>local Venture Labss</li>
			<li>start-up schemes run by local enterprise agencies and others</li>
			<li>schemes for young starters such as Shell LiveWIRE and Prince's Trust</li>
			<li>schemes for starters aged 50 plus, eg PRIME </li>
			<li>schemes for women starters including Women in Business, and everywoman</li>
			<li>schemes for starters from ethnic minority communities including the African Caribbean Business Network and the Asian Business Network (ABDN)</li>
			<li>financial advisers</li>
			<li>accountants</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Bear in mind that you will almost certainly have to pay for the specialist knowledge and advice from financial advisers and accountants. You can <a href="https://www.unbiased.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search for an independent financial adviser on the Independent Financial Adviser Promotion website</a>.</p>
		<p>It is a good idea to have an accountant for your business. Although having an accountant is an additional expense, it is a good investment. For more information, see our guide on how to <a href="/finance-and-grants/financial-planning-and-accounts/choose-and-work-with-an-accountant.php">choose and manage an accountant</a>.</p>

The Trust offers advice, opportunities and financial assistance. <a href="https://www.princes-trust.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find out how the Trust can help you on the Prince's Trust website</a>.</p>
		<p>Another body that helps new businesses is Shell LiveWIRE. This organisation aims to encourage young people aged between 18 and 30 to start up their own business. <a href="https://www.shell-livewire.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find out what help you can get on the Shell LiveWIRE website</a>.</p>

		<p>You may also be entitled to Working Tax Credits. These are payments to top up the earnings of working people on low incomes, including the self-employed. You can find out about Working Tax Credits by calling the HMRC Tax Credits Helpline on Tel 0845 300 3900.</p>
