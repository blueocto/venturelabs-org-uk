		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>It can be a number of months before a new business is profitable and generating a cash surplus. You may need alternative sources of income during this period, if only to cover your outgoings. If your business does make a profit, you may want to re-invest it to help your business develop.</p>
		<p>This guide gives advice on how to keep your business afloat in the early days. It will help you work out your profits and financial needs, reduce your spending, re-invest your money and find further funds.</p>
		<p>Careful planning and the right advice can make this transitional phase much easier to manage. A Venture Labs adviser or a financial adviser can help you address these issues further.</p>
