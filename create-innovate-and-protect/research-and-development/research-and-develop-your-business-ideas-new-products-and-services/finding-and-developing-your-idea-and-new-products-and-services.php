		<h1>Research and develop your business ideas, new products and services</h1>
		<h2>Finding and developing your idea and new products and services</h2>
		<p>A new idea is often the basis for starting up a business. Many entrepreneurs spot a gap in the market and start businesses that provide a product or service that fills it. Others come up with ways to improve an existing product.</p>
		<h3>Coming up with a new idea</h3>
		<p>If you want to start a business but don't yet have an idea to work with, there are many ways to go about identifying one. The following questions may help:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Do you have any particular skills that could form the basis of a new business?</li>
			<li>Are you aware of a gap in the market in the industry that you currently work in?</li>
			<li>Do you have a hobby that could be turned into a business?</li>
			<li>Has there ever been a time when you needed a particular service or product that nobody else provides? If you needed it, there is a good chance that other people will too.</li>
			<li>Can you help solve any of the problems posted by government departments and public sector organisations on the Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) website? SBRI is a government scheme supported by the Technology Strategy Board that awards funding to develop innovative ideas.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Developing your idea</h3>
		<p>Once you have got a business idea, take time to refine it. This will help you to decide whether it could be the foundation of a successful business.</p>
		<p>There are various established methods of developing a business idea. You can:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>conduct <strong>market research</strong> to discover whether your idea fills a gap in the market - see our guide on <a href="/sales-and-marketing/marketing/market-research-and-market-reports.php">market research and market reports</a></li>
			<li><strong>brainstorm</strong> your idea with friends, colleagues or staff - they can give different perspectives on the idea and may know if anyone else is doing the same thing</li>
			<li>think about whether your idea can take advantage of an opportunity created by <strong>new technologies</strong>, eg by trading online</li>
			<li>consider whether <strong>social trends</strong> will affect demand for your product, eg the increasing demand for organic food or concerns about global warming and carbon footprints</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Developing new products and services</h3>
		<p>There's a lot at stake when you are developing a new product or service. To minimise risks and allocate investment and resources wisely, you should consider a number of factors, including customer needs and design, whilst also clearly defining your plans. For more information, see the page on the <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/research-and-development/product-life-cycle/development-stage-of-a-product-life-cycle.php">development stage of a product life cycle</a> in our guide to the <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/research-and-development/product-life-cycle.php">product life cycle</a>.</p>

		<h3>Support for businesses developing new ideas</h3>
		<p>Designing Demand is a practical mentoring programme developed to help small to medium-sized businesses and technology start-ups use design to improve performance.</p>
		<p>It helps businesses embed effective processes for the management of design and innovation and gives managers the skills to exploit design by spotting opportunities, briefing designers and running projects that deliver.</p>
		<p>Designing Demand is part of a range of support offered to businesses in England through the government's Solutions for Business portfolio.</p>
