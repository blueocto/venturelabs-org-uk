		<h1>Support networks and facilities for innovation and R&amp;D</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		
		<img src="/_img/NP1040.gif" width="94" height="62"  alt="" />

		<p>Business success is often driven by innovation. In the UK a wide range of initiatives are available to help small businesses make the most of their research and development programmes.</p>
		<p>Schemes and networks supported by the government offer businesses access to expert advice from specialist organisations as well as other businesses. These include Chambers of Commerce and the Enterprise Europe Network as well as a number of online networks.</p>
		<p>As location can also be a vital factor in the success of your business, science parks and assisted areas have been established to help companies grow and to promote science and technology.</p>
		<p>This guide explains what support is available to businesses. It covers schemes and networks that provide practical advice or that can put you in touch with others that can help. It also explains how science parks and similar environments work and how they could benefit your business.</p>
