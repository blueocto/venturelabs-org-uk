		<h1>Product life cycle</h1>
		<h2>What is a product life cycle?</h2>
		<p>All products or services created or provided by your business have a life cycle. This is the period that runs from the initial idea and development of a product to its withdrawal from the market and beyond. Read about how to understand the impact of goods and services across their life cycle in our guide on <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/design-for-business-success/ecodesign-for-goods-and-services.php">ecodesign for goods and services</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>Did you know?</h2>
		<p>There are several Government or affiliated organisations who offer a range of products and services that can help your business with design, innovation, intellectual property, measurement and standards needs.</p>

		<p>Depending on the type of product or service you launch, the length of a product's life cycle will vary substantially. For example, a fashionable item may have a life cycle of only a few months, whereas an everyday item may have one lasting years.</p>
		<p>A product's marketplace life cycle typically goes through the following main stages:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>development</strong> - the product or service is designed and physically created</li>
			<li><strong>introduction</strong> - the product or service is launched and marketed to a small group of customers</li>
			<li><strong>growth and maturity</strong> - the product or service is marketed to a wider audience and further iterations are produced</li>
			<li><strong>decline</strong> - the product or service either comes to its natural end or is re-developed</li>
		</ul>

		<p>To understand more about the levels of revenue generated at different stages of a product's life cycle, see our example product life cycle curve below.</p>

			<!-- </a> -->
		</p>
		<p>When developing a new product or service you should assess the following key points:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>design</strong> - how efficient the product is, how it can be produced and how it can be easily manufactured</li>
			<li><strong>materials</strong> - how you can use the best or most cost effective materials to increase profit margins, improve the environmental impact of your product, or reduce financial risk</li>
			<li><strong>manufacture</strong> - how to make the manufacturing process more efficient, or reduce costs</li>
			<li><strong>retail</strong> - how to optimise costs incurred through packaging or transportation</li>
			<li><strong>use</strong> - how you can make the product or service last longer in order to increase customer satisfaction</li>
			<li><strong>end of life</strong> - how materials or ideas from your service or product can be recycled</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You need to think about how each of these will affect the various areas of your profitability.</p>
