		<h1>Product life cycle</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img src="/_img/GI1400.JPG" width="78" height="118"  alt="" />
		<p>All products or services that your business offers will change throughout their life cycle. A product life cycle is the period that begins with the initial idea for the development of a product or service to the eventual withdrawal of that product from the market.</p>
		<p>There are several stages involved in developing, selling and using a product. By better understanding them, you can increase the profitability, interest and demand for your product or service.</p>
		<p>This guide explains the various stages involved in a life cycle. It also covers how you can increase your profits, generate increased interest, and the ideal time to start developing and bringing a new idea to the market. There's also information on life cycle analysis and understanding the environmental impact of your product throughout the different stages of its lifecycle.</p>
