			<p>The commercial exploitation of new ideas is vital to the survival and prosperity of British businesses. If you can get new products to the market faster than your rivals, you will become more competitive. Academic research can often help businesses develop new ideas or enhance existing ones.</p>
			<p>One way that businesses can develop new ideas is to form relationships with universities and other research institutions. Your business can benefit commercially from research into processes and technologies relevant to your activities, while universities and colleges gain new sources of funding, and researchers achieve a better understanding of industry needs.</p>
			<p>This guide looks at the different ways you can work with universities or colleges. It also looks at key government-sponsored schemes and funding competitions supporting partnership projects.</p>
